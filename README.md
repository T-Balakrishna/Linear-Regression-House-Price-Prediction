# 🏠 Linear Regression — House Price Prediction

## 📘 Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model applies data preprocessing, feature scaling, and regression techniques to deliver accurate pricing estimates on real-world datasets.

## 🧠 Objective
To build a predictive model that helps estimate house prices efficiently and supports decision-making in the real estate market.

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: [House Price Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

Contains structured features like:
- Lot area  
- Year built  
- Overall quality  
- Number of bedrooms/bathrooms  
- Sale price (target)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle  

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Feature correlation analysis  
3. Train-test split and normalization  
4. Linear regression model training  
5. Model evaluation (MSE, R² Score)  
6. Visualization of predictions vs. actual values  

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high prediction accuracy on test data  
- Model effectively captured linear relationships among features  

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Incorporate regularization (Ridge/Lasso)
- Feature engineering for categorical attributes  
- Implement model explainability using SHAP values
